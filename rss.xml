            <title>Paradisus-Paradoxum Collection</title>
            <description>It's an undeniable fact that i'm the worlds biggest fan of MYTH &amp; ROID's hit 2016 single Paradisus-Paradoxum. I've listened to it multiple times every day for around 2.5 years. Naturally, I have come across many covers and variations on the original, for which I have contained on this webpage</description>

            <title>Yesterweb: Requiem of Silence</title>
            <description>"Selective use of reason is highly characteristic of ideologues. It is then no wonder why the Yesterweb summary is filled with this sort of politically motivated illogy. Itâ€™s no wonder yesterweb remained a fart sniffing contest as opposed to a serious, practical effort to improve anything."</description>

God, after all, does not accept second-rate sacrifices."</description>

            <title>Schizo-Ramblings About The Trolley Problem</title>
            <description>"With the realization that allowing the 5 people to die was actually killing them due to omission, my view has changed on the trolley problem. I now believe ontology and consequentialism play a very mute role in this variation. Truly, if in both situations I am killing people, either by commission or omission, then indeed, the ontological belief that life is sacred, and that it should be preserved in the greatest numbers possible holds supreme."</description>
