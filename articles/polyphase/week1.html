			<h3>Day 2 - Tuesday, May 9th 2023</h3>
		</div>

		<p>Today went significantly better than yesterday; Many of the problems I experienced on day one have partially
			subsided. It wasn't all great though.<br><br>
			I've found the first waking period (between 0500 and 0930) to be brutal. I absolutly need to be doing
			something during this period, or risk falling asleep. Fortunately, this makes the first nap of the day all
			the more delightful. Speaking of:<br><br>
			Unlike yesterday, I actually got some sleep during both my morning and afternoon nap. Let me tell you, they
			are positivly wonderful. I wake up feeling like i've slept for hours, all in 20 minutes!<br><br>
			<a href="https://www.polyphasic.net/">Polyphasic.net</a> strongly recommends against the use of caffine
			while on a polyphasic sleep schedule. Indeed, that is probably good advice, but not advice I am willing to
			follow. I can attest that at least at this point in time, coffee has been excelent for getting me through
			thr 6 hour gap between my monring and afternoon naps. I am worried about caffine affecting the quality of
			the second nap, but I am also drinking around half of what I normally would. It's probably not a big deal.
