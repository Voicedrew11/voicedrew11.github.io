			<h3>Introduction</h3>
		</div>
		<p>
			At some point in the last year, the question of "if you could have any super power, what would it be" came
			up in my
			friend group. The awnsers were fairly standard; some wanted invincibility, and others wanted the power to
			grant
			themselves powers (valid)... I, however desired something very specific, something everyone has thought
			about, but has
			been forced to abandon due to biological
			or (perhaphs as we soon find out) societal restrictions.<br><br>
			My awnser? The ability to forgo sleep without incuring any negative concequences whatsoever. It's kind of a
			strange
			awnser (especially compared to the others), but time is the only truly finite resource in this world; Be as
			wealthy or
			powerful as you like, time marches on.<br><br>
			This was, of cource, just fantasy at the time... Until I watched a video by Tris (the excellent mind behind
			"No
			Boilerplate", a Rust focused channel) recite his experience with a 2 month experiment with polyphasic sleep.
			I found
			myself rather perseuaded to try it out. I will not try and fail to explain it. Watch the video instead!

			Now that you are up to speed, I can explain some of the personal choices I made in more detail<br>
			<br>
			The first thing I needed to consider was the schedule I was going to adhere to. At first, <a
				href="https://www.polyphasic.net/everyman-1/">Everyman 1</a> looked promising, reducing my total sleep
			time by
			~2 hours. There are, however, glaring problems, particularly in regards to scheduling. E1 demands that I
			take a nap
			at around noon, which has two problems.

			<li style="font-size: 20px;">Not anywhere consistently quiet and dark in my school</li>
			<li style="font-size: 20px;">Lunch is my primary socializing time; loosing it would be a problem</li>

		</ol>

		<p>
			Other schedules, such as <a href="https://www.polyphasic.net/dual-core-1/">Dual Core 2</a> were also
			promising, however, I found the specific timings of DC2 to be non-viable due to the primary core being
			placed at a time when my home would be bustling.<br>
			<br>
			Realizing that none of the prefab schedules on the website would work for me, I decided to make myown by
			taking <a href="https://www.polyphasic.net/everyman-2/">Everyman 2</a> and shifting it forward by 1.5 hours.
			My result was the following:

			<p>The first nap is placed just before school, and the second just after. Finally! A viable schedule.</p>
