            <h1>Markdown Madness</h1>
<h3>03/09/2023</h3>
<p>If you didn't know, I write these blog posts in markdown: An extreamly simple markup language that allows you to format text while also leaving it 'human readable'.</p>
<p>Since I began, I have been copying my markdown files into an online html coverter, copying a previous blog post's html file to use as a template, and then copying my converted html into the file. This was extreamly annoying, and often lead to mistakes on my part. I wrote a python script to deal with this problem</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Voicedrew11/0ad60aac17304f8859002a5fe78346e4.js"></script>

<p>Super simple right? It takes in a markdown file and spits out a complete <a href="https://voicedrew.xyz/">voicedrew.xyz</a> blog post. Header image and all! Of course, feel free to modify this script and use it however you want.</p>
