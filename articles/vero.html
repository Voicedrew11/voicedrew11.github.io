		<h1>Acer Aspire Vero (Antichrist)</h1>
		<h3>14/06/2023</h3>
		<p>On the shelves of my local Staples exists an anomalous artifact; A crime against both man and nature; The antichrist himself.
			<br/>
			<br/>
The Acer Aspire Vero. A laptop that’s chassis is made of recycled plastic, the trackpad is made of ocean glass and the packaging is 100% recyclable, but what of the components? <strong>NOPE.</strong> All the parts are brand new. Here are some excerpts from the website¹:
			<br/>
			<br/>
“By adopting recycled plastic in the creation of Aspire Vero, we [Acer] are demonstrating our commitment to reducing carbon emissions. This year, we have increased our reduction of CO2 emissions from 21% to 30%, in our quest for a greater positive impact on the environment.”
			<br/>
			<br/>
So this laptop is a “demonstration” of Acer’s commitment to carbon emissions? How about we take a look at the marketing for the various colourschemes?
			<br/>
			<br/>
“Recalling the idyllic tree—the colour [of the laptop] acts as a subtle tribute to eco-conscious living.”
			<br/>
			<br/>
Translated: 「 The colour of this laptop will constantly remind you of how good of a person you are.」
			<br/>
			<br/>
“Designed to evoke considerations for our oceans, such as the Mariana Trench.”
			<br/>
			<br/>
Translated:「 Look at how much I care about the turtles!」
			<br/>
			<br/>
“The name itself implies what Vero’s purpose is—to act as a building block for sustainability.”
			<br/>
			<br/>
Right from the mouth of the dragon. This laptop’s purpose is not to act as a portable computer (like one might accept), but rather as a statement. This is a fad product.
			<br/>
			<br/>
I am not (in principle) against such a device, but do not be fooled. If Acer really cared about the environment, they would have included the option of a replaceable battery and upgradable CPU. Clearly Acer didn’t get the <i>reduce</i> and <i>reuse</i> part of the memo.
			<br/>
			<br/>
It fills me with great pain knowing some environmentalist schmuck got suckered into buying this. If you really want a laptop that's good for the environment, go give a used ThinkPad a new home. It won’t even cost you $900!
