            <h1>My First Time at Church</h1>
<h3>2023-09-30</h3>
<p>It's been a couple of months since I first read the gospel of John and converted to Christianity. I've been flirting with the idea of going to church ever since, but didn't feel like I had read enough to really appreciate it, and overall felt intimidated. </p>
<p>So last week, I took a leap of faith and decided to attend my first service. I decided to attend and Anglican church, which while being a very complicated decision, can be boiled down to 1) Being very liturgically traditional and 2) Being very open about certain theological issues that I don't quite understand yet.</p>
<p>I asked my Mom if she would come with me and she accepted. She normally attends a very 'low church' southern baptist church where they play rock music, so this was also quite different for her. She kept whispering questions to me about what food we might get after the service, which I found quite annoying at the time, but in retrospect, it was rather funny.</p>
<p>I must say, it was absolutly wonderful. Everyone was super kind to me and I even took took the Eucharist for the first time. I keenly look forward to tomorrow.</p>
