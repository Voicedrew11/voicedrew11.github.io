# 95 Theses to the web revivalists

1. Web revival is politically agnostic
2. Any attempt to insert a political agenda into web revival is subversive.
3. Complaining about the current state of the internet will (probably) not make it better.
4. What did you say in your manifesto that someone else hasn't already said in theirs?
5. Making something that inspires others will make the internet better.
6. Woe to the site admin, who does nothing but fill his website with links to vestigial social media. 
7. Hotlinking is the greatest of insults; Reserve it for those whom you hate.
8. It is not any corperations' fault that the internet is so shit today.
9. Blame falls upon internet users, who in their sloth prefer convienience over independance.
10. What is special about your website? Why is it worth visiting?
11. It is impossible to bring back the freedoms of the old internet without freedom of speech (go back and read agora thread on yesterweb)
12. Forums!
13. Your site ought not to be not meerly a destination, but a stop on a longer journey. 
14. A webring with hundreds of members, who are not catagorized nor segregated in any way, is just as pointless as an actual keyring that holds 800 keys.
