Damn yo, I write about "things" alot. I guess theres no helping it. 


## Why Ereader?



So, why get an ereader? Why not just read paperbacks? Before purchasing my model I had the same contentions, but there are key advatnages to ereaders that paperbacks simply lack. The most obvious aspect is it's size; In a volume around a third of the size of your typical book, you can carry around thousands of epubs, and a couple dozen manga volumes. 

## Proscriptions

Here is some buying advice if you are interested in getting an ereader after this blog post:
- Do not buy a Kindle; Amazon's ecosystem is super annoying when it comes to sideloading. My KOBO, by contrast, allows me to upload books to my reader with a cable. (Older Kindle models may still suport this).
	+ If you end up getting a KOBO, use Koboify or an equivalent program to convert your standard epubs into KOBO's epub format. It is not strictly necissary, but it displays better on the device, and reads more accurate "time to compleation" data.
- Get one with an adjustable frontlight, with both normal and night reading options. Being able to read at night without the lights on is one of the best perks of owning an ereader.
- Weebs, use KCC (Kindle Comic Converter) to format your CBZ files for your device. Ensure stretch and upscale is **FULLY** checked (not indeterminate). This will also save you a lot of space on your reader, as the raw images get scaled down to fit your device's screen. Fully checking this option alse prevents the images from getting streched.
