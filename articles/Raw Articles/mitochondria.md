# Mitochondiria

Present in nearly all types of human cell, mitochondria are vital to 
our survival. They generate the majority of our adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP), the energy currency of the cell.



Mitochondria are also involved in other tasks, such as signaling between cells and cell death, otherwise known as apoptosis.


In this article, we will look at how mitochondria work, what they look 
like, and explain what happens when they stop doing their job correctly.
