# The Webmaster's Creed

I affirm that calling one's prefession of ideas a "manifesto" is cringe, and that calling it a creed is based. 

My goal is not to tear something down, or to complain endlessly about things I have no concievable control over, but rather to build a shining light on a hill with my own hands; To inspire with creation.

My website shall not be a destination, but rather, a small part of a large journey; Every visitor to my site should have dozens of places to go after they depart.

I will not trade my freedom for convienience, nor creativity for ease. What I make will be mine, down to the last tag and rule.

I stress the importance of buttons and banners, and the importance of sharing them. They are like little roadsigns on the information superhighway.
