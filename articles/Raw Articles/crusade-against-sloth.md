# Holy Crusade Against Sloth

I've had a pretty lame couple of  months. I feel like i've been living a hÎ»lf life ever since work ended and I started school. This is doubtlessly due to my tame responsibilities at the moment. I have three classes a week for a total of two days at school. The only other commitments I have during the week are church on Sunday and I still get into the gym, but not consistantly. It's interesting how I managed to go 7 days a week without fail when I was working every day for 8 hours, but can't manage this same feat when I have dramatically more time.
