    <h1>Alixie the Prophet</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>"Toronto, 2077. Andrew "Voicedrew" Canada is almost about to die. He decides to check his computer one last time, for a bit of nostalgia, when he spots a website he hadn't used since 54 years ago. He checks on his old account and finds none other than that half-elf as his old pfp. It can't be. He quickly moves his mouse, before getting kicked out of the chair by none other than Emilia herself. "Damn you..." She then shoots him in the head. "Sorry, Andrew. But we will always be together". End of the story." - Alixie</p>
