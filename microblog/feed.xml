    <h1>Alixie the Prophet</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>"Toronto, 2077. Andrew "Voicedrew" Canada is almost about to die. He decides to check his computer one last time, for a bit of nostalgia, when he spots a website he hadn't used since 54 years ago. He checks on his old account and finds none other than that half-elf as his old pfp. It can't be. He quickly moves his mouse, before getting kicked out of the chair by none other than Emilia herself. "Damn you..." She then shoots him in the head. "Sorry, Andrew. But we will always be together". End of the story." - Alixie</p>

    <h1>Kamala Harris</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>"I apparently flew past her [Kamala Harris] with a cart full of hot dogs and bacon, disturbing her conversation with the manager. I heard her say something along the lines of "A man on a mission, I like that" or whatever." - Lamp Fool</p>
<p>"I also met Kamala Harris at a grocery store a while ago, I guess it must have been some tour she was doing. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything. She said, "Oh, like you're doing now?" I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but she kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?" and closing her hand shut in front of my face. Very weird." - No56</p>
<p>"I met her in a grocery store as well I saw her trying to walk out of the store with like fifteen milky ways without paying for them. The clerk kept telling her that she needed to pay for them but she kept pretending like she didn't hear until finally she turned around and went to the counter. The cashier took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times but she stopped him and told him to scan each individually "to prevent any electrical infetterence." Like that's even a word, lmao" - bnuungus</p>
<p>Is there anyone on this damn site who hasn't met Kamala Harris?</p>

    <p>"Where men are forbidden to honor a king they honor millionaires, athletes, or film stars instead, even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served. Deny it food and it will gobble poison." - C.S. Lewis</p>

    <h1>The Benevolant Tyrants</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>"Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience." — C.S. Lewis</p>

    <h1>Microblog</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>So I spent most of the day setting up this microblogging system rather than studying. It works by creating a 2 temporary files, one for the title and another for the content of the post. It then opens neovim and allows me to edit the files. Once that is complete, the files are parsed, deleted, and then the page is generated. I use Luke Smith's sup script to update the RSS feed. <br><br>
I think I will keep this microblog as RSS exclusive, at least for the moment. The individual pages will always be available, of course.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
    <h1>Progress</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>“We all want progress. But progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man. There is nothing progressive about being pig-headed and refusing to admit a mistake. And I think if you look at the present state of the world it's pretty plain that humanity has been making some big mistake. We're on the wrong road. And if that is so we must go back. Going back is the quickest way on.” ― C.S. Lewis</p>
