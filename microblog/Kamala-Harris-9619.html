    <h1>Kamala Harris</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>"I apparently flew past her [Kamala Harris] with a cart full of hot dogs and bacon, disturbing her conversation with the manager. I heard her say something along the lines of "A man on a mission, I like that" or whatever." - Lamp Fool</p>
<p>"I also met Kamala Harris at a grocery store a while ago, I guess it must have been some tour she was doing. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything. She said, "Oh, like you're doing now?" I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but she kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?" and closing her hand shut in front of my face. Very weird." - No56</p>
<p>"I met her in a grocery store as well I saw her trying to walk out of the store with like fifteen milky ways without paying for them. The clerk kept telling her that she needed to pay for them but she kept pretending like she didn't hear until finally she turned around and went to the counter. The cashier took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times but she stopped him and told him to scan each individually "to prevent any electrical infetterence." Like that's even a word, lmao" - bnuungus</p>
<p>Is there anyone on this damn site who hasn't met Kamala Harris?</p>
