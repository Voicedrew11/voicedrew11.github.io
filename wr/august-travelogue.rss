<h3 id="31-08-2023">31/08/2023</h3>
<p>EFAP, a podcast related to film, game, and critic criticism, recently had its 250th episode; it’s five-year anniversary. I’ve been a big fan of the show for years, so naturally, I tuned in.</p>
<p>On the show, they played <a href="https://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/">Absurd Trolley Problems</a>... A game where one chooses either to pull or not pull the lever in an increasingly absurd set of trolley problems.</p>
<p>When they started playing the game, I found it extremely appalling that the cast almost unanimously agreed that diverting the train was the most moral action in the classic trolley problem. Here was my reasoning:</p>
<p>1) The train heading towards the 5 people is the state of nature.</p>
<p>2) By pulling, not pulling the lever, I am allowing them to die; not killing them.</p>
<p>3) Pulling the lever, and the subsequent death of the 1 person, is not the state of the world, but rather a consequence of my direct actions.</p>
<p>Here is the thought that put a monkey wrench into my reasoning: Is inaction an action? Or rather, ‘is it true that I am not killing anybody when I decide to do nothing?’ Here is the Oxford Dictionary definition of “inaction”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“lack of action where some is expected or appropriate:”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To further illustrate the problem, here is an absurd version of the trolley problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The trolley is headed towards one person. You can pull the lever to divert it to the other track, killing nobody instead. What do you do?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this instance, would you not say that by allowing the train to continue in its path, you are killing the person on the tracks through your inaction?</p>
<h2 id="commission-vs-omission">Commission vs Omission</h2>
<p>I believe a key part of understanding the trolley problem is understanding the difference between crimes of commission, and crimes of omission. Crimes of commission constitute acts in which evil is caused as a consequence of malice, whereas crimes of omission are evils which are caused by a lack of action.</p>
<p>My error, then, was not recognizing crimes of omission as crimes at all.</p>
<h2 id="my-skin-in-the-game">My Skin In The Game</h2>
<p>Before coming to my previous realization, I believed that pulling the lever constituted a consequentialist action, whereas not pulling the lever was ontological. My ontological belief was essentially, “It is wrong to kill an innocent person, even if it’s a net positive”.</p>
<p>With the realization that allowing the 5 people to die <em>was</em> actually killing them due to omission, my view has changed on the trolley problem. I now believe ontology and consequentialism play a very mute role in this variation. Truly, if in both situations I am killing people, either by commission or omission, then indeed, the ontological belief that life is sacred, and that it should be preserved in the greatest numbers possible holds supreme.</p>

      <title>Being a "Flip Phone Main"</title>

<h1>Being a "Flip Phone Main"</h1>
  </header>

<div class="post">
<p>Around this time last year, my Samsung Galaxy S8 abruptly stopped working. Either it wouldn’t turn on or the display completely died. Regardless, I needed a quick and affordable replacement phone mainly for work. I really didn’t want another phone as I hardly used my last one but I didn’t have a choice when it came to work, so I settled on a $30 Alcatel flip phone. It runs an operating system called KaiOS, which apparently is a fork of the discontinued FirefoxOS, which is interesting. In this article, I’m gonna talk a bit about the pros and cons of daily driving a flip phone.</p>

<h2 id="the-pros">The Pros</h2>
<p>Your phone is no longer a potential source of distraction - it is merely a tool for communication or time management. I didn’t spend much time on my phone to begin with, but this really cut it down to only when I needed it, no more and no less. The form factor is quite nice as well, I like the smaller fit of the phone in the hand, and the crisp clap of closing the phone is very satisfying. Having actual tactile buttons on the phone feels nice, though I would prefer to have a “sliding phone” with a full keyboard. The battery life on it is great, which makes sense considering I only use it a few minutes each day. I can go 4-5 days without charging it sometimes, and it’s fully charged within a couple of hours. My phone plan is only $15 a month which is very affordable.</p>

<h2 id="the-cons">The Cons</h2>
<p>Technologies like SMS/MMS and voice calls over a cellular network are terrible for privacy, as all of the information being transmitted is unencrypted, and is even sold to data brokers and government agencies to spy on you. When you do actually use the phone to send messages, typing on it can be a pain. The predictive text is awful so I disabled it. I can get quick messages across in a snap, but anything of length instantly becomes a chore. With the model of phone I have, there is no option to block numbers, so if there’s a number that keeps harassing me, I’m basically screwed. The phone needs to be restarted frequently, as the OS becomes slow and very unresponsive over time.</p>

<h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re the kind of person who only uses calls/text sparingly and doesn’t need a constant distraction in their pocket, then consider switching to a flip phone (or more generally a “dumb phone”). If your use case doesn’t quite line up with the limitations, consider using an Android device with a debloated ROM on it, and only use the necessary apps.</p>
